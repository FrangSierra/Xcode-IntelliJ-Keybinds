# How to install?
-  Download the `IntelliJ.idekeybindings` file
-  Open your terminal and move to `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/KeyBindings/
-  Execute `open .` to open the actual folder and copy the `IntelliJ.idekeybindings` file.
-  Open Xcode
-  Go to `Preferences/Key binding and choose your profile.

It can crash on the first time you import this theme, but after reset XCode it should work like a charm ;)

**Feel free to improve it or add more modifications!! It's a work in progress and not all the bindings from IntelliJ are 100% portable for the reserved use of command ⌘ for modifiers**
